## Overview

This Stacks smart contract implements a secure and flexible token distribution mechanism with advanced features for controlled token allocation, beneficiary management, and retrieval.

## Key Features

### Token Distribution
- Controlled token allocation with customizable unit allocation
- Supports mass beneficiary authorization
- Single-claim mechanism to prevent multiple withdrawals
- Configurable lock periods for token retrieval

### Access Control
- Operator-only administrative functions
- Beneficiary authorization and revocation
- Comprehensive access checks

### Logging and Transparency
- Detailed event logging system
- Tracks all significant contract actions

## Contract Components

### Constants
- Error codes for various scenarios
- Predefined system constants

### Data Structures
- Fungible token: `shadow-token`
- Maps for:
  - Entitled beneficiaries
  - Disbursement records
  - Event logging

### Primary Functions

#### Operator Functions
- `authorize-beneficiary`: Add individual beneficiary
- `revoke-beneficiary`: Remove beneficiary access
- `mass-authorize-beneficiaries`: Bulk beneficiary authorization
- `adjust-allocation`: Modify token allocation amount
- `adjust-lock-duration`: Update token lock period

#### User Functions

(authorize-beneficiary 'BENEFICIARY-ADDRESS)

;; Beneficiary claims tokens
(retrieve-tokens)

;; Operator retracts unused tokens after lock period
(retract-unused-tokens)
```

## Security Considerations
- Strict operator-only administrative controls
- Single-claim mechanism prevents double-spending
- Configurable lock periods
- Comprehensive error checking

## Deployment Requirements
- Stacks blockchain environment
- Minimum token supply for distribution
